Landing a Spacecraft on the Moon ðŸš€ðŸŒ•

This project simulates the process of landing a spacecraft on the Moon. The code models key stages of a lunar landing, including descent, approach, and powered landing sequences, while taking into account real-world factors like gravity and thruster adjustments.


Features
Descent and Approach Simulation: Calculates trajectory and speed adjustments needed for safe lunar descent.
Powered Descent: Models controlled thruster usage to slow down the descent, allowing precise landing.
Landing Sequence: Implements logic for obstacle avoidance and touchdown safety.
Post-Landing Checks: Simulates systems checks post-landing to verify successful operations.

Technologies Used

Language: [C]
Libraries: [stdio.h]


Purpose
This project serves as a learning tool for understanding the complexities of space missions and the physics behind landing on celestial bodies. It could be a valuable reference for students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in space exploration.
